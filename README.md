There's a discussion I find interesting around the question: "Should adults tell children to follow their dreams?"

For many, the inital reaction is "What? Of course we should be telling kids to follow their dreams!"

I believe there was a survey done finding that currently, the most popular profession amongst kids is to be a **YouTuber** (or other influencer).

Right. So it doesn't make sense for all these kids to be Youtubers. In other words, if all of these kids actually did follow their dreams successfully, it would cause serious economic problems: basically there would be way too many Youtubers (not to mention underpayment and grueling competition between them).

Others would also argue that by telling kids to follow their dreams you are setting them up for disappointment.

Now, I personally don't have a strong opinion about to what extent we should tell kids to follow their dreams. Because on the other hand, there is obviously huge merit in kids having genuine passion for their career.

But for me, there is one critical adjustment I think many adults should make: If you're going to tell a kid to follow his dreams, it should be informed by **_what he is going to do for other people_**. Your profession, your job, by definition is work that is considered **valuable by the economy**. The essence of a job is to contribute work to your community such that you can get paid for it! So, if you expect to get paid for your time, you have to understand that what you do must be valuable to other people. When kids are dreaming up their dream job, they should be asking themselves: "What do I want to do for other people? How can I contribute?" Even if this isn't at the core of their reasoning, it should certainly be a consideration on the table. A job is not a job if it does not serve somebody else and therefore does not make money.

Put another way: kids can't expect to be entirely selfish when dreaming of their future. Kids shouldn't just focus on whatever lifestyle they want most. They should be asking themselves what role they want to play in their community. "I want to eat food all day." Okay, you might be able to make that into a job somehow, but in doing so you are necessarily finding a way to somehow make your work valuable to other people. Otherwise, if its not considered valuable by anyone other than yourself, then its not a career worth pursuing.

Now, this is important not only on a practical level, but for personal happiness and fulfilment as well. Generally people derive meaning from their work. Having a responsibility, doing something difficult, having knowledge and skills that are sought after, doing work that people depend on or appreciate — these are the things that bring life-long meaning. It feels good to be needed. It feels good to have people depend on you, and to be called upon in critical situations. Feeling that you do not contribute to your community in any way is generally not good for a person's self-worth and mental health. A career is your identity. It's your way of expressing yourself and doing your part. What role do you want to play?

If you have a community at any scale — from a family, to a tribe, to a city, to a nation — you want the individuals of that community to feel like they carry their own weight. That's really important for a person's mental well-being. If they feel like they are a burden, are not needed, are incabable of contributing, it can be detrimental. We need to support such people so that they can get out of that situation.
