Books, movies, music, food, video games, TV, psychedelics, essays, articles, social media, podcasts — let’s call these things forms of **art**: *experiences created by humans for other humans*

Clearly some of these **art formats** can be more addicting than others: you often see excessive consumption of Netflix, Xbox or TikTok to a degree that is deemed unhealthy, destructive, or regrettable

But I think it’s up to each individual to decide what they consider healthy/unhealthy. Furthermore, people have different preferences about what forms of art they like. Old people often have a bias towards primitive and old-fashioned forms of art like **books**, **newspaper** or **board games**, and have bias against modern forms of art like **video games** and **virtual reality**. Many people obsess over **music**. My dad loves **food**. Many enjoy **sports entertainment** such as UFC or the World Cup.

Every single one of these art formats are fascinating and worth **appreciating**, if you can. Every single one has great experiences to offer. Yes, it is possible to lose control, over-indulge and thereby compromise health or elicit regret. But to deprive oneself of art all-together, would be misguided, I think, and a mistake. *To think any of these art formats are inherently superior to another implies and exposes your ignorance.*

To me, the important thing is to be disciplined and in-control. Me personally, I reckon that I am more disciplined and in-control of my **art consumption** than anyone I’ve known. In terms of format, my personal favorites are movies, podcasts, video essays (often found on YouTube) and video games. My current indulgence is Elden Ring, a recent video game argued to be the greatest video game of all time, so me deciding to give it a go was a no-brainer.

Video Games are underrated in my opinion, so here are some important facts:

* The video games often combine multiple art formats: illustration, animation, writing, world-building, music, sound design
* The gaming industry makes more money that the **music** and **movie** industry combined
* Games account for 70% of the Apple App Store revenue

Anyway, my bottom line is:

**Art** only becomes **crack** when you lose control
